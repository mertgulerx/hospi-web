# Hospi Web

## Who said that fullstack with pure Java is impossible? Hospital Management System (Hospi) is now available on the web for a **UI demo!**

This is a **pure Java project** that uses JavaFX, so it is released only on the web to **showcase** the user interface.  
Many functions will **not work** because it is **not designed to be a web application** :)
